# Language Server Clients

This directory contains LS clients for IDEs that
will work with the AWS Documents Language Server.

This will enable you to easily test changes to the
language server as if it were an extension.

## Jetbrains

To setup the jetbrains sample client you must update LspPreloadingActivity to point to the server.js file from the server.
